# ReAFFINE
This repository contains Python code of the ReAFFINE method (Real-time Assessment of Flash Flood Impacts at pan-European Scale). During heavy rainfall events, this method can be used to estimate in real time the locations of the most severe flash flood impacts across Europe. The method is described and tested on two major flash flood events in the following publication: "Real-time assessment of flash flood impacts at pan-European scale: The ReAFFINE method", J. Ritter, M. Berenguer, S. Park, D. Sempere-Torres (2021), https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421010726
